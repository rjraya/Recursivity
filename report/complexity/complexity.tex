\begin{definition}[Static complexity measure]
	Given an acceptable system of indices $\{ \varphi_e \}_{e \in \omega}$ for the partial recursive functions.
	
	We call a static complexity measure any total recursive function $m$, and call complexity or size of e the number m(e).
	Then we can naturally talk of the minimal complexity of a partial recursive
	function as the least complexity of its programs (this notion obviously depends
	on both to and the acceptable system).
